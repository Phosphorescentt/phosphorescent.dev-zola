<p>Last week I had an extremely thought provoking conversation with a careers adviser from
<a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>. He asked me a lot of interesting questions and
in particular he pressed me quite hard on why I'm hesitant to get into the AI safety
space. I didn't have a great answer in the call and I can tell that I have a lot of
complex feelings on the topic that I need a solid way of expressing. This article is
written to give myself an opportunity to consolidate and express my feelings.</p>
<p>In this article I will attempt to avoid talking about things that I haven't given a lot
of thought, because positions that are not well thought out yet are not worth
presenting. I also acknowledge that a lot of the arguments below are based on how I
<em>feel</em> right now as opposed to cold hard facts about the state of the world. Again, this
is because I am attempting to convey <em>why</em> I am hesitant and having feelings is an
occupational hazard of being human.</p>

</h2>
<p>Starting off with an easy one, I have just moved to Bristol with my partner and most of
the AI safety industry is currently situated in London. I'm not saying I'm never going
to move back to London, but so far I'm having a pretty good time in Bristol. I think
point this is pretty easily countered by organising AI safety stuff in Bristol and
semi-regularly attending events in London (this is a direct recommendation from the
careers adviser). I think something like this would probably be a very welcome addition
to the Bristol Tech Hub community and I'd probably be more than happy to organise some
events with them. All this being said, it's definitely some extra friction that makes it
harder and I think not having a huge community already will put a lot of work on me to
start building that environment.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-very-reluctant-to-use-ai-tools-in-my-own-work">I am very reluctant to use AI tools in my own work<a class="zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600" href="#i-am-very-reluctant-to-use-ai-tools-in-my-own-work" aria-label="Anchor link for: i-am-very-reluctant-to-use-ai-tools-in-my-own-work"> ¶</a>
</h2>
<p>I am getting the impression that if I wanted to work in the AI safety space, in order to
be competitive, I would have to use AI tools. I think there are probably far more
reasons I'm AI-averse in my workflows, but the top few reasons are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="hype">Hype<a class="zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600" href="#hype" aria-label="Anchor link for: hype"> ¶</a>
</h3>
<p>I am psychologically allergic to anything that has huge amounts of hype surrounding it.
I've fallen into the hype trap with many things before only to be extremely
disappointed. I'm an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/about/">r/patientgamer</a> and
I detest 99.99% of the stuff produced by the hype of the web 3.0 movement. I see a lot
of similar promises and marketing coming from the AI space and although it seems like a
lot of it has more credence than the cryptobros, it makes me uncomfortable how much
non-technical people are screaming and shouting from the rooftops about it.</p>

</h3>
<p>I think this argument has been done to death at this point, but it's worth reprinting in
my own words here. I'm early in my career. This means my priority should be learning as
much as I can. One of the best lecturers at my university (Dave Wood for any Warwick
maths alumni) really hammered home that "maths is not a spectator sport". By this he
means that the only way that you really learn anything is by engaging deeply with the
problems in front of you and coming up with your own solutions, not just reading the
solutions from the textbook. Offloading huge swathes of code-writing to agentic systems
is like reading solutions from the textbook. If I write the code myself, I learn far
more about my tech stack, the systems I'm working on and, most importantly, the business
case for the feature.</p>
<p>I think there is a tradeoff about figuring out how to use AI effectively for learning,
but I don't find the LLM feedback loop engaging. This means that I don't wake up with
any innate desire to actually try and hone this skill. Of course this is something that
can be worked on with time and some persistence, but I just don't have much motivation
because I don't find it as satisfying as sitting with a book/docs written by the
experts. In short: I really like learning and using AI systems for anything means that I
learn less.</p>

</h3>
<p>I want to start this one by highlighting that I don't think software engineering will
stop being a job title, but what I do think is highly possible is that SWEs will start
writing less and less code and they will just start becoming a translator for the
product managers into actionable technical items which will then get delegated to Claude
Code.</p>
<p>I like all aspects of being a software engineer, both the problem solving with code and
the squishy parts where you're trying to draw technical requirements from a member of
the product team. I think the reason I like doing both of those things is because of
the contrast between the two. I like spending the morning solving fun little logic
puzzles to make my code work (read: vim macros to bulk edit code, type definitions that
leave the code open for extension, ensuring the code is robustly testable etc.), and
then spending the afternoon figuring out what the PM meant on the ticket and learning
about the business context surrounding my work.</p>
<p>If agentic LLM systems start taking away the first part, all we're left with is the
second part, and I really don't think I will find the second part that much fun if it's
all that I'm doing. Am I in a privileged position where I find my job fun? Yes. Do I
feel like I deserve the right to protect that part of my job? Also yes.</p>

<p>This is probably a longer post for a different time, but it seems
likely to me that we are going to have more issues related to misuse of AI by existing
social systems and power structures than we are likely to have issues from capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#what-can-you-do-concretely-to-help">Based on an 80,000 hours problem profile on the
topic</a>,
it's likely that my best contribution would be through technical AI safety. With the
above in mind, I don't think that I would be contributing in the way that I think is
meaningful. In other words: because I am more worried about social issues than
capabilities issues I should be working in AI governance, but I don't think I'm well
suited to that type of work.</p>

</h2>
<p>To roughly quote the careers adviser, "there are huge economic incentives to make sure
this technology is embedded everywhere". This is obviously true. LLMs are everywhere
already and they're only getting more capable and more integrated with our existing
systems. Someone should make sure that this is done safely. It would be pretty
catastrophic if the Tesco chat bot was willing to tell everyone how to produce
neurotoxins; it's important to understand the capabilities and limitations of these
systems if they're going to be deployed everywhere.</p>

</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/3Xumj#neglectedness">80,000 hours estimate that as of 2022 there were ~400 people working on AI
safety globally</a>. That is a disgustingly small number
given how huge some of the impacts are predicted to be. Even if the predicted impacts
are off by several orders of magnitude, it seems silly that we're spending ~1,000 times
less on safety than we are on capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-biased">I am biased<a class="zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600" href="#i-am-biased" aria-label="Anchor link for: i-am-biased"> ¶</a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of my positions as stated above likely come from the fact that I am a software
engineer from outside the AI space who interacts with lots of other software engineers
outside the AI space. Naturally, this means that I hear a lot more anti-AI sentiment
than pro-AI arguments. 80,000 hours sent across a huge list of introductory AI safety
reading and events that look worth reading and attending. I don't think I can honestly
say I have a balanced view on modern AI systems, their impacts and where their
capabilities will be in 5-10 years without at least attempting to take this seriously
and doing some reading.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion"> ¶</a>
</h1>
<p>I think some of the issues listed above are quite high signal, but some of
them are definitely lower signal. AI safety being mostly based in London is a low signal
reason not to get involved as there are very clear steps to mitigate that issue, but
being reluctant to use AI tools and social safety vs capabilities safety are higher
signal.</p>
<p>I also think there is likely to be a lot of cognitive dissonance wrapped up in the words
that I've written and the points that I've articulated. Working in AI safety would
represent a large change in my character from someone who isn't particularly interested
in the technology to someone who interacts with it full time and uses it to solve
problems.</p>
<p>In summary, this post was a good exercise in getting my thoughts out of my brain and
into some intelligible ideas. This has cleared up a lot of the way that I feel and has
left me clearer in my position. This position is that lot of the reasons I hesitate are
purely inside my head and something that I have to get over in my own time by doing
lots of reading.</p>
