<p>I spent a bunch of time unemployed this year (thanks redundancy). So I redid my
dotfiles. Goodbye AstroNvim, hello <code>init.lua</code>. I had two motivations for doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn't understand what AstroNvim was doing to implement all this functionality, and
when I wanted to add new things I always found it confusing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sylvanfranklin/videos">Vimoth√©e Chalamet</a> reignited my love
for Vim and it's myriad of well thought out and modular features.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I am running nightly Neovim, using the inbuilt package manager for a select few
plugins and I have a single <code>init.lua</code> which I constructed entirely myself. And the
thing that enabled me was <code>:h</code>.</p>
<p><code>:h</code> is (neo)vim's inbuilt help command. Typing <code>:h i</code> brings up some <em>very</em> extensive
documentation about what the <code>i</code> character does, and it puts it in the context of other
similar commands. Obviously I knew about <code>:h</code> before, but I never really understood how
to parse the information that was on my screen.</p>
<p>Having now written a little bit of lua and done some fiddling with a full config myself,
these <code>:h</code> pages are a goldmine. The combination of having <em>extremely</em> detailed docs for
a specific command, surrounded by other similar commands is incredible. Want to know how
to open a terminal buffer? <code>:h terminal</code>. Read a few sentences and scroll a bit and now
you know how to open a terminal buffer and what the keybinds are to perform actions in
it. All of that, for free, built into your editor, and it's completely offline.</p>
<p>I now feel much more confident with configuring my editor and I rarely feel like I have
to consult a search engine to get my answers. I wish I'd invested in this skill sooner,
I could've saved myself so much time.</p>
<p>You should learn to read the manual for your favourite tools too.</p>
