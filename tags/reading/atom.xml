like you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be reading, I have a pretty simple strategy for how to pick books
worth reading: &lt;strong&gt;pick something that&#x27;s been on the shelves in high street book stores
for years.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s really that simple. Books that have been on sale in physical stores for a long time
must be good enough to have some cultural sticking power which means they&#x27;re probably
worth reading. The best case is that you&#x27;ve read a classic book that is culturally
relevant and you enjoyed it. The worst case is that you&#x27;ve read a classic book that is
culturally relevant and you&#x27;re more informed for it. And realistically if you&#x27;re reading
for fun then you don&#x27;t have to finish anything, you can just give the book a go and put
it down if you hate it. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now and I&#x27;ve been much better
off for it. It removes a lot of the decision paralysis about what to read. Now I can
settle for just picking up a copy of something like 1984, Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice or War &amp;amp;
Peace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extension to this idea is that you also pick books that people in your bring up
regularly. Using this addition has a similar tradeoff to the above: if you read a book
that someone recommended to you and you hate it, you have at least gained one new thing
to talk to them about. If you love it, then you had a good time and you&#x27;ve still got the
conversation point! I have also applied this idea to more types of creative work than
just books. I wouldn&#x27;t have watched Breaking Bad, The Silence of the Lambs or Memento if
I hadn&#x27;t been given glowing recommendations by my friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one (possibly huge) caveat to this approach: I feel very strongly that it&#x27;s
important to read &amp;amp; engage with creative works that are part of modern culture. If you
aren&#x27;t interested in reading to understand the zeitgeist (which is a totally valid
reason to read!) then this method may not work so well for you. But if you do give this
a go, let me know how it works out for you :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
