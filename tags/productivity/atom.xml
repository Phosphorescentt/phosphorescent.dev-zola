        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/learn-to-rtfm/">&lt;p&gt;I spent a bunch of time unemployed this year (thanks redundancy). So I redid my
dotfiles. Goodbye AstroNvim, hello &lt;code&gt;init.lua&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. I had two motivations for doing this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&#x27;t understand what AstroNvim was doing to implement all this functionality, and
when I wanted to add new things I always found it confusing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@sylvanfranklin&#x2F;videos&quot;&gt;Vimothée Chalamet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; reignited my love
for Vim and it&#x27;s myriad of well thought out and modular features.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am running nightly Neovim, using the inbuilt package manager for a select few
plugins and I have a single &lt;code&gt;init.lua&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which I constructed entirely myself. And the
thing that enabled me was &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is (neo)vim&#x27;s inbuilt help command. Typing &lt;code&gt;:h i&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; brings up some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; extensive
documentation about what the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; character does, and it puts it in the context of other
similar commands. Obviously I knew about &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; before, but I never really understood how
to parse the information that was on my screen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having now written a little bit of lua and done some fiddling with a full config myself,
these &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; pages are a goldmine. The combination of having &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; detailed docs for
a specific command, surrounded by other similar commands is incredible. Want to know how
to open a terminal buffer? &lt;code&gt;:h terminal&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Read a few sentences and scroll a bit and now
you know how to open a terminal buffer and what the keybinds are to perform actions in
it. All of that, for free, built into your editor, and it&#x27;s completely offline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now feel much more confident with configuring my editor and I rarely feel like I have
to consult a search engine to get my answers. I wish I&#x27;d invested in this skill sooner,
I could&#x27;ve saved myself so much time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should learn to read the manual for your favourite tools too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/a-month-with-a-broken-phone/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/a-month-with-a-broken-phone/">&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month since &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phosphorescent.dev&#x2F;pages&#x2F;i-broke-my-phone&#x2F;&quot;&gt;I broke my phone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s been
quite a good month honestly. I don&#x27;t feel tied to my phone at all times and it&#x27;s
definitely become more of a tool for me than something I feel compelled to use.
Unfortunately, iOS screen time is terrible so the UI doesn&#x27;t actually show me any data
before 2025-06-30. But my current week average usage is consistently below 3h&#x2F;day. A lot
of this is also comprised of Netflix for background noise or Spotify, which, for
whatever reason, still counts up screen time even when the phone is locked. All this in
mind, it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like a big improvement, I just wish I had data to back it up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this month I have had a lot more free time and it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;d be lying if I
said I spent it all well. There was more Shapez 2, ETS2 &amp;amp; Deadlock than I&#x27;d have liked,
but it&#x27;s much easier to play a single game of Deadlock and then decide to do something
useful than it is to get myself off Reddit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlock games come in discrete units and they take up ~50 minutes maximum so it&#x27;s harder to lose time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlock is way less addictive than basically everything on my phone, so it&#x27;s easier to pull myself away
from it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say this is a massive upgrade, because my phone still does what I need it to
do, without most of the distracting stuff tacked on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/i-broke-my-phone/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/i-broke-my-phone/">&lt;p&gt;...and I don&#x27;t intend on fixing it. Here she is in all her glory:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;broken_phone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An iPhone 13 with a broken screen. There are two thick white lines in the right half of the screen. The lines are brighter than the rest of the screen.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped it like 75cm (2.5ft) and this is what happened. I&#x27;m
pretty mad about it. I even had a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cfgHnSflZ04&quot;&gt;Mous phone
case&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the damage to the screen is purely cosmetic; the touch input still works as
you&#x27;d expect. Unfortunately the two white bars are exactly where lots of apps decide to
put useful information. I can get round this by swiping up from the bottom of the screen
and gently massaging the app into a space that is unobstructed. It&#x27;s just more effort
than if it weren&#x27;t broken.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-m-not-going-to-repair-it&quot;&gt;Why I&#x27;m not going to repair it&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#why-i-m-not-going-to-repair-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-i-m-not-going-to-repair-it&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s still entirely usable for all the things I need to use it for. Online banking,
emails in a pinch, texting my partner when I&#x27;m at Tesco and I forgot to make a shopping
list. It&#x27;s still capable of doing all those things, but it&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; annoying to
look at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes across surprisingly well in the photo; the two white bars are very bright.
Like, brighter than the max brightness the OS usually allows bright. This alone has made
my phone so much less appealing to look at. It low-key hurts my eyes even under direct
sunlight when my pupils are most constricted. Now imagine how it is to look at when
you&#x27;re on the way to bed. Scrolling through Hacker News whilst I&#x27;m brushing my teeth is
not something that crosses my mind anymore. And then once I&#x27;ve made it to bed there&#x27;s
zero chance I&#x27;m looking at my phone again once the lights have been dimmed, because it&#x27;s
going to flashbang me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And better than just helping me fix my sleep, this has also improved my relationship
with my phone in like 99% of cases. It&#x27;s so frustrating to look at that I&#x27;m just... not
inclined to pick it up unless I absolutely have to. I have no inclination to pick it up
and scroll through Instagram whilst I&#x27;m waiting for my M&amp;amp;S Tuscan Style Sausage Penne
pasta to microwave. I&#x27;d genuinely rather look out the window.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-should-break-your-phone-too&quot;&gt;You should break your phone too&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#you-should-break-your-phone-too&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-should-break-your-phone-too&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to say that I will accept no liability or responsibility for any damage that
you do or don&#x27;t decide to do to your own devices. That being said, this is the most
liberated from my Psychological Torture Rectangle™ I have felt in a long time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying for a while to recapture my attention from Zuckerberg &amp;amp; The Tech
Barons. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts. If you know me, you know I&#x27;m really anal about
notifications - I literally only get push notifications if my partner texts me. I also
installed a blocker so that I can&#x27;t get on most of my social media things during the day
and I only have limited access during the evenings. All of this didn&#x27;t really help.
Turns out all it takes is significant damage to a £1000 piece of tech!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now spend less time whittling away at my mental health by watching the world rot on
Twitter and I have so much more attention to direct into the stuff that I care about. So
I&#x27;ve removed a mental health sink and introduced a mental health source all in one go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing for my phone to be an intentional part of my day rather than an
automatic one. I recommend finding a way to make this happen for yourself at all costs.
Even if it involves breaking your phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
