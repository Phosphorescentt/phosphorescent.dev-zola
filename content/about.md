Heya! I'm Phos! I'm a 24 year old, London-based software engineer with a background in mathematics. I mostly write backend-data-style Python at the moment, but am trying to expand my horizons into systems programming via Rust. I spend more time than I care to admit lurking on HN and [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) with the hope that I internalise more of the good ideas shared in the comments than the bad ones. I am very interested in all aspects of software engineering and I'm always super excited to learn new things about computers and the systems & culture that enable us to work with them.

Outside of the technical sphere, I am very passionate about bass music (drum and bass in particular) mostly because it is unbelievably good for my soul (more on that one soon).

And when I don't feel like being productive, you can probably catch me playing Factorio or Deadlock.
