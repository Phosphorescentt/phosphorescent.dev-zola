Heya! I'm Phos! I'm a 24 year old, Bristol-based software engineer with a background in
mathematics. I mostly write backend-data-style Python at the moment, but am trying to
expand my horizons into systems programming via Rust. I spend more time than I care to
admit lurking on Hacker News and [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) with the hope that I
internalise more of the good ideas than the bad ones. I am very interested in all
aspects of software engineering and I'm always super excited to learn new things about
computers and the systems & culture that enable us to work with them.

Outside of the technical realm, I am very passionate about bass music (drum and bass in
particular) mostly because it is unbelievably good for my soul. I also love spending
time with my dog, Monty, and my loving partner, Kat.

And when I don't feel like being productive, you can probably catch me playing Factorio,
Celeste, Deadlock or Trackmania.
