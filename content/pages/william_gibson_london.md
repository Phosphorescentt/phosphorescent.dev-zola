> This was nothing like Tokyo, where the past, all that remained of it, was nurtured with
a nervous care. History there had become a quantity, a rare thing, parcelled out by
government and preserved by law and corporate funding. Here it seemed the very fabric of
things, as if the city were a single growth of stone and brick, uncounted strata of
message and meaning, age upon age, generated over the centuries to the dictates of some
now all but unreadable DNA of commerce and empire.
