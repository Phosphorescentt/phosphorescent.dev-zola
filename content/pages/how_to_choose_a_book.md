If you don't read very much and you feel overwhelmed by the number of books you feel
like you *should* be reading, I have a pretty simple strategy for how to pick books
worth reading: **pick something that's been on the shelves in high street book stores
for years.**

It's really that simple. Books that have been on sale in physical stores for a long time
must be good enough to have some cultural sticking power which means they're probably
worth reading. The best case is that you've read a classic book that is culturally
relevant and you enjoyed it. The worst case is that you've read a classic book that is
culturally relevant and you're more informed for it. And realistically if you're reading
for fun then you don't have to finish anything, you can just give the book a go and put
it down if you hate it. I've been doing this for a while now and I've been much better
off for it. It removes a lot of the decision paralysis about what to read. Now I can
settle for just picking up a copy of something like 1984, Pride & Prejudice or War &
Peace.

There is one (possibly huge) caveat to this approach: I feel very strongly that it's
important to read & engage with creative works that are part of modern culture. If you
aren't interested in reading to understand the zeitgeist (which is a totally valid
reason to read!) then this method may not work so well for you. But if you do give this
a go, let me know how it works out for you :)
