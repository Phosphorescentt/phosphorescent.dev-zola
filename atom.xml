        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/learn-to-rtfm/">&lt;p&gt;I spent a bunch of time unemployed this year (thanks redundancy). So I redid my
dotfiles. Goodbye AstroNvim, hello &lt;code&gt;init.lua&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. I had two motivations for doing this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&#x27;t understand what AstroNvim was doing to implement all this functionality, and
when I wanted to add new things I always found it confusing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@sylvanfranklin&#x2F;videos&quot;&gt;Vimothée Chalamet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; reignited my love
for Vim and it&#x27;s myriad of well thought out and modular features.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am running nightly Neovim, using the inbuilt package manager for a select few
plugins and I have a single &lt;code&gt;init.lua&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which I constructed entirely myself. And the
thing that enabled me was &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is (neo)vim&#x27;s inbuilt help command. Typing &lt;code&gt;:h i&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; brings up some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; extensive
documentation about what the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; character does, and it puts it in the context of other
similar commands. Obviously I knew about &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; before, but I never really understood how
to parse the information that was on my screen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having now written a little bit of lua and done some fiddling with a full config myself,
these &lt;code&gt;:h&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; pages are a goldmine. The combination of having &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; detailed docs for
a specific command, surrounded by other similar commands is incredible. Want to know how
to open a terminal buffer? &lt;code&gt;:h terminal&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Read a few sentences and scroll a bit and now
you know how to open a terminal buffer and what the keybinds are to perform actions in
it. All of that, for free, built into your editor, and it&#x27;s completely offline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now feel much more confident with configuring my editor and I rarely feel like I have
to consult a search engine to get my answers. I wish I&#x27;d invested in this skill sooner,
I could&#x27;ve saved myself so much time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should learn to read the manual for your favourite tools too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was nothing like Tokyo, where the past, all that remained of it, was nurtured with
a nervous care. History there had become a quantity, a rare thing, parcelled out by
government and preserved by law and corporate funding. Here it seemed the very fabric of
things, as if the city were a single growth of stone and brick, uncounted strata of
message and meaning, age upon age, generated over the centuries to the dictates of some
now all but unreadable DNA of commerce and empire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/a-month-with-a-broken-phone/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/a-month-with-a-broken-phone/">&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month since &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phosphorescent.dev&#x2F;pages&#x2F;i-broke-my-phone&#x2F;&quot;&gt;I broke my phone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s been
quite a good month honestly. I don&#x27;t feel tied to my phone at all times and it&#x27;s
definitely become more of a tool for me than something I feel compelled to use.
Unfortunately, iOS screen time is terrible so the UI doesn&#x27;t actually show me any data
before 2025-06-30. But my current week average usage is consistently below 3h&#x2F;day. A lot
of this is also comprised of Netflix for background noise or Spotify, which, for
whatever reason, still counts up screen time even when the phone is locked. All this in
mind, it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like a big improvement, I just wish I had data to back it up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this month I have had a lot more free time and it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;d be lying if I
said I spent it all well. There was more Shapez 2, ETS2 &amp;amp; Deadlock than I&#x27;d have liked,
but it&#x27;s much easier to play a single game of Deadlock and then decide to do something
useful than it is to get myself off Reddit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlock games come in discrete units and they take up ~50 minutes maximum so it&#x27;s harder to lose time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlock is way less addictive than basically everything on my phone, so it&#x27;s easier to pull myself away
from it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say this is a massive upgrade, because my phone still does what I need it to
do, without most of the distracting stuff tacked on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/i-broke-my-phone/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/i-broke-my-phone/">&lt;p&gt;...and I don&#x27;t intend on fixing it. Here she is in all her glory:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;broken_phone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An iPhone 13 with a broken screen. There are two thick white lines in the right half of the screen. The lines are brighter than the rest of the screen.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped it like 75cm (2.5ft) and this is what happened. I&#x27;m
pretty mad about it. I even had a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cfgHnSflZ04&quot;&gt;Mous phone
case&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the damage to the screen is purely cosmetic; the touch input still works as
you&#x27;d expect. Unfortunately the two white bars are exactly where lots of apps decide to
put useful information. I can get round this by swiping up from the bottom of the screen
and gently massaging the app into a space that is unobstructed. It&#x27;s just more effort
than if it weren&#x27;t broken.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-m-not-going-to-repair-it&quot;&gt;Why I&#x27;m not going to repair it&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#why-i-m-not-going-to-repair-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-i-m-not-going-to-repair-it&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s still entirely usable for all the things I need to use it for. Online banking,
emails in a pinch, texting my partner when I&#x27;m at Tesco and I forgot to make a shopping
list. It&#x27;s still capable of doing all those things, but it&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; annoying to
look at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes across surprisingly well in the photo; the two white bars are very bright.
Like, brighter than the max brightness the OS usually allows bright. This alone has made
my phone so much less appealing to look at. It low-key hurts my eyes even under direct
sunlight when my pupils are most constricted. Now imagine how it is to look at when
you&#x27;re on the way to bed. Scrolling through Hacker News whilst I&#x27;m brushing my teeth is
not something that crosses my mind anymore. And then once I&#x27;ve made it to bed there&#x27;s
zero chance I&#x27;m looking at my phone again once the lights have been dimmed, because it&#x27;s
going to flashbang me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And better than just helping me fix my sleep, this has also improved my relationship
with my phone in like 99% of cases. It&#x27;s so frustrating to look at that I&#x27;m just... not
inclined to pick it up unless I absolutely have to. I have no inclination to pick it up
and scroll through Instagram whilst I&#x27;m waiting for my M&amp;amp;S Tuscan Style Sausage Penne
pasta to microwave. I&#x27;d genuinely rather look out the window.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-should-break-your-phone-too&quot;&gt;You should break your phone too&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#you-should-break-your-phone-too&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-should-break-your-phone-too&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to say that I will accept no liability or responsibility for any damage that
you do or don&#x27;t decide to do to your own devices. That being said, this is the most
liberated from my Psychological Torture Rectangle™ I have felt in a long time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying for a while to recapture my attention from Zuckerberg &amp;amp; The Tech
Barons. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts. If you know me, you know I&#x27;m really anal about
notifications - I literally only get push notifications if my partner texts me. I also
installed a blocker so that I can&#x27;t get on most of my social media things during the day
and I only have limited access during the evenings. All of this didn&#x27;t really help.
Turns out all it takes is significant damage to a £1000 piece of tech!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now spend less time whittling away at my mental health by watching the world rot on
Twitter and I have so much more attention to direct into the stuff that I care about. So
I&#x27;ve removed a mental health sink and introduced a mental health source all in one go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing for my phone to be an intentional part of my day rather than an
automatic one. I recommend finding a way to make this happen for yourself at all costs.
Even if it involves breaking your phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/im-hesitating-to-get-involved-with-ai-safety/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/im-hesitating-to-get-involved-with-ai-safety/">&lt;p&gt;Last week I had an extremely thought provoking conversation with a careers adviser from
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;80000hours.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;80,000 Hours&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He asked me a lot of interesting questions and
in particular he pressed me quite hard on why I&#x27;m hesitant to get into the AI safety
space. I didn&#x27;t have a great answer in the call and I can tell that I have a lot of
complex feelings on the topic that I need a solid way of expressing. This article is
written to give myself an opportunity to consolidate and express my feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I will attempt to avoid talking about things that I haven&#x27;t given a lot
of thought, because positions that are not well thought out yet are not worth
presenting. I also acknowledge that a lot of the arguments below are based on how I
&lt;em&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; right now as opposed to cold hard facts about the state of the world. Again, this
is because I am attempting to convey &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I am hesitant and having feelings is an
occupational hazard of being human.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- toc --&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-do-hesitate-to-get-involved-with-ai-safety&quot;&gt;Why I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; hesitate to get involved with AI safety&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#why-i-do-hesitate-to-get-involved-with-ai-safety&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-i-do-hesitate-to-get-involved-with-ai-safety&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-safety-is-mostly-london-based&quot;&gt;AI safety is mostly London based&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#ai-safety-is-mostly-london-based&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ai-safety-is-mostly-london-based&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off with an easy one, I have just moved to Bristol with my partner and most of
the AI safety industry is currently situated in London. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m never going
to move back to London, but so far I&#x27;m having a pretty good time in Bristol. I think
point this is pretty easily countered by organising AI safety stuff in Bristol and
semi-regularly attending events in London (this is a direct recommendation from the
careers adviser). I think something like this would probably be a very welcome addition
to the Bristol Tech Hub community and I&#x27;d probably be more than happy to organise some
events with them. All this being said, it&#x27;s definitely some extra friction that makes it
harder and I think not having a huge community already will put a lot of work on me to
start building that environment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-very-reluctant-to-use-ai-tools-in-my-own-work&quot;&gt;I am very reluctant to use AI tools in my own work&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#i-am-very-reluctant-to-use-ai-tools-in-my-own-work&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: i-am-very-reluctant-to-use-ai-tools-in-my-own-work&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am getting the impression that if I wanted to work in the AI safety space, in order to
be competitive, I would have to use AI tools. I think there are probably far more
reasons I&#x27;m AI-averse in my workflows, but the top few reasons are as follows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hype&quot;&gt;Hype&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#hype&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: hype&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am psychologically allergic to anything that has huge amounts of hype surrounding it.
I&#x27;ve fallen into the hype trap with many things before only to be extremely
disappointed. I&#x27;m an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;patientgamers&#x2F;about&#x2F;&quot;&gt;r&#x2F;patientgamer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
I detest 99.99% of the stuff produced by the hype of the web 3.0 movement. I see a lot
of similar promises and marketing coming from the AI space and although it seems like a
lot of it has more credence than the cryptobros, it makes me uncomfortable how much
non-technical people are screaming and shouting from the rooftops about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;heavy-ai-use-is-a-learning-footgun&quot;&gt;Heavy AI use is a learning footgun&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#heavy-ai-use-is-a-learning-footgun&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: heavy-ai-use-is-a-learning-footgun&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this argument has been done to death at this point, but it&#x27;s worth reprinting in
my own words here. I&#x27;m early in my career. This means my priority should be learning as
much as I can. One of the best lecturers at my university (Dave Wood for any Warwick
maths alumni) really hammered home that &quot;maths is not a spectator sport&quot;. By this he
means that the only way that you really learn anything is by engaging deeply with the
problems in front of you and coming up with your own solutions, not just reading the
solutions from the textbook. Offloading huge swathes of code-writing to agentic systems
is like reading solutions from the textbook. If I write the code myself, I learn far
more about my tech stack, the systems I&#x27;m working on and, most importantly, the business
case for the feature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is a tradeoff about figuring out how to use AI effectively for learning,
but I don&#x27;t find the LLM feedback loop engaging. This means that I don&#x27;t wake up with
any innate desire to actually try and hone this skill. Of course this is something that
can be worked on with time and some persistence, but I just don&#x27;t have much motivation
because I don&#x27;t find it as satisfying as sitting with a book&#x2F;docs written by the
experts. In short: I really like learning and using AI systems for anything means that I
learn less.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-job-will-be-way-less-fun&quot;&gt;My job will be &lt;em&gt;way&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; less fun&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#my-job-will-be-way-less-fun&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: my-job-will-be-way-less-fun&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start this one by highlighting that I don&#x27;t think software engineering will
stop being a job title, but what I do think is highly possible is that SWEs will start
writing less and less code and they will just start becoming a translator for the
product managers into actionable technical items which will then get delegated to Claude
Code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like all aspects of being a software engineer, both the problem solving with code and
the squishy parts where you&#x27;re trying to draw technical requirements from a member of
the product team. I think the reason I like doing both of those things is because of
the contrast between the two. I like spending the morning solving fun little logic
puzzles to make my code work (read: vim macros to bulk edit code, type definitions that
leave the code open for extension, ensuring the code is robustly testable etc.), and
then spending the afternoon figuring out what the PM meant on the ticket and learning
about the business context surrounding my work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If agentic LLM systems start taking away the first part, all we&#x27;re left with is the
second part, and I really don&#x27;t think I will find the second part that much fun if it&#x27;s
all that I&#x27;m doing. Am I in a privileged position where I find my job fun? Yes. Do I
feel like I deserve the right to protect that part of my job? Also yes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-safety-vs-capabilities-safety&quot;&gt;Social safety vs. capabilities safety&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#social-safety-vs-capabilities-safety&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: social-safety-vs-capabilities-safety&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a longer post for a different time, but it seems
likely to me that we are going to have more issues related to misuse of AI by existing
social systems and power structures than we are likely to have issues from capabilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;80000hours.org&#x2F;problem-profiles&#x2F;artificial-intelligence&#x2F;#what-can-you-do-concretely-to-help&quot;&gt;Based on an 80,000 hours problem profile on the
topic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
it&#x27;s likely that my best contribution would be through technical AI safety. With the
above in mind, I don&#x27;t think that I would be contributing in the way that I think is
meaningful. In other words: because I am more worried about social issues than
capabilities issues I should be working in AI governance, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m well
suited to that type of work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To roughly quote the careers adviser, &quot;there are huge economic incentives to make sure
this technology is embedded everywhere&quot;. This is obviously true. LLMs are everywhere
already and they&#x27;re only getting more capable and more integrated with our existing
systems. Someone should make sure that this is done safely. It would be pretty
catastrophic if the Tesco chat bot was willing to tell everyone how to produce
neurotoxins; it&#x27;s important to understand the capabilities and limitations of these
systems if they&#x27;re going to be deployed everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-are-very-few-people-working-on-safety&quot;&gt;There are very few people working on safety&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#there-are-very-few-people-working-on-safety&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: there-are-very-few-people-working-on-safety&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;3Xumj#neglectedness&quot;&gt;80,000 hours estimate that as of 2022 there were ~400 people working on AI
safety globally&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. That is a disgustingly small number
given how huge some of the impacts are predicted to be. Even if the predicted impacts
are off by several orders of magnitude, it seems silly that we&#x27;re spending ~1,000 times
less on safety than we are on capabilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-biased&quot;&gt;I am biased&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#i-am-biased&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: i-am-biased&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my positions as stated above likely come from the fact that I am a software
engineer from outside the AI space who interacts with lots of other software engineers
outside the AI space. Naturally, this means that I hear a lot more anti-AI sentiment
than pro-AI arguments. 80,000 hours sent across a huge list of introductory AI safety
reading and events that look worth reading and attending. I don&#x27;t think I can honestly
say I have a balanced view on modern AI systems, their impacts and where their
capabilities will be in 5-10 years without at least attempting to take this seriously
and doing some reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think some of the issues listed above are quite high signal, but some of
them are definitely lower signal. AI safety being mostly based in London is a low signal
reason not to get involved as there are very clear steps to mitigate that issue, but
being reluctant to use AI tools and social safety vs capabilities safety are higher
signal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think there is likely to be a lot of cognitive dissonance wrapped up in the words
that I&#x27;ve written and the points that I&#x27;ve articulated. Working in AI safety would
represent a large change in my character from someone who isn&#x27;t particularly interested
in the technology to someone who interacts with it full time and uses it to solve
problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this post was a good exercise in getting my thoughts out of my brain and
into some intelligible ideas. This has cleared up a lot of the way that I feel and has
left me clearer in my position. This position is that lot of the reasons I hesitate are
purely inside my head and something that I have to get over in my own time by doing
lots of reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

more about AI safety as an option.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/zola-table-of-contents-shortcode/">&lt;p&gt;To build this website, I&#x27;m using a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For my
longer posts, I&#x27;d like to have a table of contents somewhere on the page for easier
navigation, but I don&#x27;t want it on every page. This could&#x27;ve been achieved by making a
separate template for the page with a table of contents, but I wanted something a bit
more flexible that lets me insert the table of contents wherever I want. Apparently
there&#x27;s not an easy way to do this, so I&#x27;ve come up with a bit of a hack based on an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getzola&#x2F;zola&#x2F;issues&#x2F;584&quot;&gt;old
GitHub issue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zola has functionality called
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;content&#x2F;shortcodes&#x2F;&quot;&gt;shortcodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which lets you
call functions to insert text into your markdown before rendering the markdown into into
HTML. Unfortunately, because shortcodes are expanded &lt;em&gt;before&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the markdown is parsed,
they don&#x27;t have access to the attributes of the page. These attributes are exposed at
the template level, but not the shortcode level. So we have to do some tomfoolery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we create a shortcode called &lt;code&gt;toc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that accepts no arguments and returns a constant
string &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- toc --&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we can then replace that string with a call to a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keats.github.io&#x2F;tera&#x2F;docs&#x2F;#macros&quot;&gt;Tera
macro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that actually generates the HTML for
the table of contents. A specific implementation of method can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Phosphorescentt&#x2F;phosphorescent.dev-zola&#x2F;commit&#x2F;5fb8df16284563c74ee17c43118658f954e686a4#diff-ec96e0fc2f34ad383e10ee3af3c78f2ec64cdf16eba5352cc184f01802f950c9&quot;&gt;this
commit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when we write some markdown, we can insert &lt;code&gt;toc()&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; surrouneded by double curly
brackets wherever we want, and we will get a table of contents rendered correctly.
Below is an example of what the table of contents for this website will look like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- toc --&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;header-1&quot;&gt;Header 1&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#header-1&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: header-1&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

        <title>Automatically rename Zellij tabs with Nushell</title>

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/zellij-tab-renaming/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/zellij-tab-renaming/">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have a crippling issue with doing ungodly amounts of terminal futzing
instead of actually doing the stuff that I should be doing. To that end, I have just set
up automatic tab renaming for Zellij with Nushell and it was remarkably easy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zellij.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zellij&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a modern alternative to tmux&#x2F;screen and I&#x27;m a real
sucker for something modern and written in rust. Out of the box, Zellij has a lot of
really cool functionality, but I&#x27;m a tmux girlie. My Zellij config is very minimal to
make all the keybinds similar to tmux, the only thing that&#x27;s missing is the automatic
tab renaming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search about automatically renaming tabs in Zellij led me to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;haseebmajid.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2024-07-26-how-i-configured-zellij-status-bar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this
article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The author of this post shows two functions they have added to their fish setup. In
short, this setup uses Zellij&#x27;s CLI utility to update the title of the tab using fish&#x27;s
&lt;code&gt;fish_preexec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fish_postexec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; hooks. In particular it&#x27;s issuing a &lt;code&gt;zellij action rename-tab &amp;lt;tabname&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nushell also has similar functionality to fish in it&#x27;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nushell.sh&#x2F;book&#x2F;hooks.html#hooks&quot;&gt;hooks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Combining all this together, we
can configure a couple of hooks to rename Zellij tabs wheneve we do something in the
command line. This gives us something like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;nu&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-nu &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-nu&quot; data-lang=&quot;nu&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    pre_prompt: [ { 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        zellij action rename-tab &amp;quot;nu&amp;quot;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    } ]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    pre_execution: [ { || 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        mut repl_commandline = (commandline)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        if ($repl_commandline | str length) &amp;gt; 15 {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;            $repl_commandline = ($repl_commandline | str substring 0..14) + &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        zellij action rename-tab ($repl_commandline)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    } ]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;})
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pre_execution&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; hook is what lets us get a string value of the command currently
being run and &lt;code&gt;pre_prompt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; resets the tab name back to &quot;nu&quot; every time we return to the
repl. The only special thing of note here is the call to &lt;code&gt;str substring 0..14&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which just takes
the first 15 characters of the command being issued - just to make sure we don&#x27;t end up
with silly long tab names.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/a-conversation-on-claude-code/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/a-conversation-on-claude-code/">&lt;p&gt;Probably a bit late to the conversation on this one as I&#x27;m currently between jobs and so
I don&#x27;t have 40 minute gaps whilst tests run to read Hacker News, but Anthropic have
just released a video discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yf_1w00qIKc&quot;&gt;Claude
Code&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly this is a cool piece of tooling and this is the direction that I&#x27;d like to see
LLM&#x2F;AI stuff continue to move. Having something that keeps out of your way until you
want it is great, as opposed to things like Microsoft forcing Copilot down every GitHub
user&#x27;s throat. A CLI tool that I can use only when I want it is great! It also sets the
incentive up to build something that&#x27;s actually useful. If Claude Code isn&#x27;t useful I
just wont use it and it won&#x27;t get in my way. In other words, I am glad that we have
moved away from autocompletes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t had the chance to give Claude Code a proper once over, but already I can see a
few issues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#cost&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: cost&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, Boris is saying that you can probably get away with 5$ for the weekend,
but if you want to use Claude Code routinely then you&#x27;re looking at at least 50-100$ per
month. 100$&#x2F;month is enough money that it&#x27;s inacessible to most people and I think this
is probably going to exacerbate issues that we&#x27;re already having with inequality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just have anxiety, but letting Claude run wild on my personal machine seems
crazy. Does it do any kind of sandboxing or anything like that? It&#x27;s unclear to me, but
at face value it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s anything stopping Claude from hitting me with
an &lt;code&gt;rm -rf &#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to exfiltrate my secrets anywhere, but I just
don&#x27;t trust it not to do silly things to my system that it ought not to. In fairness,
seems like they have &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.anthropic.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;security&quot;&gt;quite granular
controls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; over what Claude can
be allowed to do in your system, so maybe I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have anxiety.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;remote-only&quot;&gt;Remote only&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#remote-only&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: remote-only&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily expect this out the gate from Anthropic as they stand
to make money off Claude Code, but I struggle to be super happy about tools whose only
backend is a paid service with no option of moving over to self hosting something. It&#x27;s
not that I disagree with Anthropic&#x27;s model, it&#x27;s just a shame to build what looks like
such a good UI and give it only a proprietary backend. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s only a matter of
time before there&#x27;s a really good open source alternative anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/vim-g-command/">&lt;p&gt;I have been using some variation of Vim on and off since ~2012. And in that time I have
learned staggeringly little about the editor. In comes &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vimgolf.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vim
Golf&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, today I learned about the &lt;code&gt;:g&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command. &lt;code&gt;g&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is short for global and
lets you run an &lt;code&gt;Ex&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command across all lines matching some pattern in your current
buffer. This can be used to quickly do things like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete all blank lines: &lt;code&gt;:g&#x2F;^\s*&amp;amp;&#x2F;d&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete all lines containing only Python comments: &lt;code&gt;:g&#x2F;^\s*# *&#x2F;d&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy all lines matching the pattern to register &lt;code&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;qaq:g&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;y A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;qaq&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
starts recording a macro into register &lt;code&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and immediately exits, leaving &lt;code&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; empty and
&lt;code&gt;y A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; appends to register &lt;code&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; each line matched)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/how-to-choose-a-book/">&lt;p&gt;If you don&#x27;t read very much and you feel overwhelmed by the number of books you feel
like you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be reading, I have a pretty simple strategy for how to pick books
worth reading: &lt;strong&gt;pick something that&#x27;s been on the shelves in high street book stores
for years.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s really that simple. Books that have been on sale in physical stores for a long time
must be good enough to have some cultural sticking power which means they&#x27;re probably
worth reading. The best case is that you&#x27;ve read a classic book that is culturally
relevant and you enjoyed it. The worst case is that you&#x27;ve read a classic book that is
culturally relevant and you&#x27;re more informed for it. And realistically if you&#x27;re reading
for fun then you don&#x27;t have to finish anything, you can just give the book a go and put
it down if you hate it. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now and I&#x27;ve been much better
off for it. It removes a lot of the decision paralysis about what to read. Now I can
settle for just picking up a copy of something like 1984, Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice or War &amp;amp;
Peace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extension to this idea is that you also pick books that people in your circle bring
up regularly. Using this addition has a similar tradeoff to the above: if you read a
book that someone recommended to you and you hate it, you have at least gained one new
thing to talk to them about. If you love it, then you had a good time and you&#x27;ve still
got the conversation point! I have also applied this idea to more types of creative work
than just books. I wouldn&#x27;t have watched Breaking Bad, The Silence of the Lambs or
Memento if I hadn&#x27;t been given glowing recommendations by my friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one (possibly huge) caveat to this approach: I feel very strongly that it&#x27;s
important to read &amp;amp; engage with creative works that are part of modern culture. If you
aren&#x27;t interested in reading to understand the zeitgeist (which is a totally valid
reason to read!) then this method may not work so well for you. But if you do give this
a go, let me know how it works out for you :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/about/">&lt;p&gt;Heya! I&#x27;m Freya! I&#x27;m a 24 year old, Bristol-based software engineer with a background in
mathematics. I mostly write backend-data-style Python at the moment, but am trying to
expand my horizons into systems programming via Rust. I spend more time than I care to
admit lurking on Hacker News and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with the hope that I
internalise more of the good ideas than the bad ones. I am very interested in all
aspects of software engineering and I&#x27;m always super excited to learn new things about
computers and the systems &amp;amp; culture that enable us to work with them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the technical realm, I am very passionate about bass music (drum and bass in
particular) mostly because it is unbelievably good for my soul. I also love spending
time with my dog, Monty, and my loving partner, Kat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I don&#x27;t feel like being productive, you can probably catch me playing Factorio,
Celeste, Deadlock or Trackmania.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Functional programming streamlines additional behaviour</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://phosphorescent.dev/pages/functional-vs-oop/">&lt;p&gt;Below is a quote I found from an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chelseatroy.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;01&#x2F;building-an-interpreter-the-visitor-pattern&#x2F;&quot;&gt;article on the visitor
pattern&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob explains that we have two ways to orient our code. We could do it with objects, by
having each of these expressions represented as classes handling all their own
operations, or we could do it with functions that switch their behavior based on which
type of expression they have been passed. The former (object) pattern makes it less
work to add a new expression class and more work to add a new behavior, since we have
to crack open every existing class to do it. The latter (functional) pattern makes it
less work to add a new behavior, since we just need to write a new function without
changing existing code. Adding a new expression, though, means cracking open all the
existing functions and adding a case to each.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of functional vs object oriented approaches that I haven&#x27;t seen
before. This perspective helps me explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I prefer functional approaches to
solving software problems as opposed to object oriented ones: my (admittedly limited)
professional experience to date has shown me that underlying data models don&#x27;t change
that much, but the behaviour often does.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it seems clear to me that we should adopt some of functional
approaches to solving problems as it gives us more agility when the product requirements
aren&#x27;t very well defined, but the shape of the data is. Of course, if you know that your
behaviour is unlikely to change very much, but your model space isn&#x27;t well understood
then perhaps an object oriented approach will work better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all personal opinion from someone who has been data engineering for most of
their career so take this interpretation with a pinch of salt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is the first project that I am documenting here. At present, it looks very
primitive and untidy which is because it is. I haven&#x27;t touched any front end in a long
time as I have mostly been data engineering with Python. So why not do a little side
project to show off my work and develop some new skills?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;tech-stack&quot;&gt;Tech Stack&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#tech-stack&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tech-stack&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is generated from a set of markdown documents and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keats.github.io&#x2F;tera&quot;&gt;Tera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; templates using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The styling is mostly done with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Tailwind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as I&#x27;ve heard good
things about it from colleagues &amp;amp; peers. My final verdict on it remains to be seen, but
my first impressions are good. I haven&#x27;t quite figured out where I want to host this
site yet, but the easiest place is probably GitHub pages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;philosophy&quot;&gt;Philosophy&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#philosophy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: philosophy&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked something simple and rolled my own theme for Zola so that I don&#x27;t get tied into
some specific way of thinking. I want to be able to share stuff in whatever way makes
the most sense for me and my use case so having someone else decide for me seems wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-improvements&quot;&gt;Future Improvements&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor text-base text-pink-600&quot; href=&quot;#future-improvements&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: future-improvements&quot;&gt; ¶&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Find out if I can specify a different template on a per page basis. This would let
me use taxonomies instead of folders, but i want to be able to have diff formatting per
term in a &lt;code&gt;category&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; taxonomy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Find a nice way to add in a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;content&#x2F;table-of-contents&#x2F;&quot;&gt;table of
contents&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Make the tags on the post page look nicer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Sort links on home page by relevant attribute from section.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Limit links on home page to highest 10-20.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Make it clear when one link on the home page ends and another one begins (cards or
something).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has been done by adding dates. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of this solution, but
it&#x27;s better than nothing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Make styling consistent across the entire website (currently I am just doing
whatever feels good and works).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Mobile.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Populate the website with some real content.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Add dates to pages listed in taxonomies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Make the &lt;code&gt;taxonomy_list.html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; template prettier.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
